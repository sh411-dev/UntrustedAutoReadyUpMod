# Untrusted AutoReadyUp Mod
Mod for game called [Untrusted](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1502660/Untrusted/). It makes you auto ready up when at least 10 players are in your lobby.

# DISCLAIMER
As for now, using the mod will not ban your account. However, as this is a modification that is against the EULA(as it uses some parts of decompiled code), it may become bannable in the future. I will not take any responsibility upon that. You are warned.
