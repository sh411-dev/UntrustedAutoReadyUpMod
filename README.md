# Untrusted AutoReadyUp Mod
Mod for game called [Untrusted](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1502660/Untrusted/). It makes you auto ready up when at least 10 players are in your lobby.

# DISCLAIMER
As for now, using the mod will not ban your account. However, as this is a modification that is against the EULA(as it uses some parts of decompiled code), it may become bannable in the future. I will not take any responsibility upon that. You are warned. 

## Installation
In order to install this mod you need to install MelonLoader first. [Link to official installation guide](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader.Installer/blob/master/README.md#how-to-install-re-install-or-update-melonloader).  

After you installed MelonLoader, follow these steps:
1. Go to Steam Library, right click on Untrusted, Manage -> Browse Local Files
2. Download [AutoReadyUpMod.dll](https://github.com/sh411-dev/UntrustedAutoReadyUpMod/releases/tag/release) and put it into the Mods folder.
3. Run the game!

## Usage
After log in you will see a message telling you some basic stuff. That is how you understand that mod is properly loaded. Now join any lobby!
